# SQLalchemy-challenge
You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that taken to accomplish this task.

We analyze and explore the Climate Data using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. With the use SQLAlchemy, we connect to our database to perform ORM queries. Through these queries, we use Pandas and Matplotlib to take the data from the ORM queries into Pandas DataFrames, and plot visualizations using matplotlib.

The queries we perform allow us to see the most recent year's temperature and precipitation data of the most active weather station from the database we connected to using SQLalchemy.
